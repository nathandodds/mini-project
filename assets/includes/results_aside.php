		<p><span class="rebecca-text-black">I’m not ready to have children just yet but I think I may want to start trying within the next year to eighteen months. It lasts for around three months so I know that as soon as I want to start trying for a baby, I won’t have to wait long to be in a position to try to   conceive. In the meantime, I can continue my sex life without worrying about protection or taking a pill everyday.</span></p>
